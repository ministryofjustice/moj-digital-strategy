##01 Foreword

####Foreword from the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice
My vision for justice reform involves being much smarter in the way we run our public services.

We can deliver better rehabilitation of offenders to stop them reoffending, a smarter system for detaining and educating teenage offenders, a cheaper and more effective prison system, a legal aid system that commands public confidence and a criminal justice and court system that works effectively and puts victims first.

Digital by default can help us achieve this vision.

It will transform the services we provide, the way we work and the systems and processes that underpin these priorities.

It enables us to design services around the needs of users to support better outcomes, whether that means tools to help rehabilitate offenders, providing victims with more information about their case, or allowing individuals to file claims more easily.

It allows us to deliver solutions at pace that are simpler, easier to use and better value for users and the government. Delivering digital services that people prefer to use allows us to dedicate alternatives like phone helplines to those who really need them, while reducing demand on these higher-cost channels.

We have already made some good progress in designing digital services, for example with information about the justice system on GOV.UK, digitising applications for Lasting
Powers of Attorney, the introduction of digital working in the criminal justice system, and moving civil legal aid applications online. We have also made data on the justice system available and accessible so the public can see how it is performing.

However, we can do a lot more to exploit digital technology to provide better services.

In future we will look to work with a wider range of technology suppliers who can deliver more efficient and flexible solutions, use common platforms with other departments to avoid duplication of services, improve our user insight and performance management to deliver services that people prefer to use, and use digital to work more effectively with the private and voluntary sectors.

The increased capability of our staff to understand the potential of digital will also lead to new policy options, with the user and digital delivery in mind at the outset.

In recent years, almost every major private company has found new and more cost-effective ways of doing things, and delivered better services as a result.

We are now doing this in the public sector, and digital will be at the heart of achieving a transformed justice system that is more effective, less costly and more responsive for our users.
