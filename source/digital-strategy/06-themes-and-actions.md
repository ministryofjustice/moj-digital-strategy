Delivering services that meet user needs, through:

1. Delivering four exemplar digital services by March 2015: prisoner visits booking; civil claims (money claims, possession claims); fee payment (starting with employment tribunal fees); and digital transformation of the [Office of the Public Guardian](http://www.justice.gov.uk/about/opg) (starting with applications for Lasting Power of Attorney).
2. Digitally redesigning all other services, prioritising those handling over 100,000 transactions per year, to meet the new [digital by default service standard](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/strategy/#initial-outline-of-proposed-digital-by-default-transactional-service-standard).
3. Establishing service managers who oversee the design, delivery and ongoing management of each service.
4. Completing the transition to [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/) for all our services.
5. Applying user insight and responding swiftly to continuously improve our services.

Relates to Government Digital Strategy actions [two](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/strategy/#action-02), [five](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/strategy/#action-05), [six](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/strategy/#action-06) and [seven](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/strategy/#action-07).

Our focus is to provide a better experience for the user and deliver greater efficiency for the department.

The Ministry of Justice invests most of its budget in prisons, probation, courts and legal aid.

We will identify the processes, services and information that support these parts of the justice system to identify where digital transformation can make the most difference.

We have already had some success, notably in:

- opening up access to data through [police.uk](http://www.police.uk/) and [open.justice.gov.uk](http://open.justice.gov.uk/)
- writing user-focused [online content for GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/browse/justice)
- introducing digital working in the criminal justice system
- digital transformation of some processes and public bodies including the Office of the Public Guardian and Legal Services Commission

However, many of our services have not been digitised. Those that have been are often ineffective, increasing demand on more expensive channels like helplines.

This presents a prime opportunity to transform the way the department operates to realise a step change in service quality and reduce costs.

###Exemplar services
We have identified four exemplar services for digital transformation by March 2015.

These have been chosen based on business priorities and data regarding transaction volumes and take-up:

1. *Prisoner visits booking:* our single biggest transactional service, which at the moment is a phone- or email-based, manual data entry system.
2. *Civil claims (money claims and possession claims):* existing digital applications which we will redesign to digitise more of the process, provide a better user experience and increase take-up.
3. *Fee payment (starting with employment tribunal fees):* this will be introduced in July 2013, and we will digitise this service and the processes that support it.
4. *End-to-end digital transformation of the Office for the Public Guardian:* this includes applications for Lasting Powers of Attorney by April 2013 and deputyships during 2013-14, and the processes that support them.

###Digitally redesigning other services
We have already embarked on a programme to redesign all of our services, where digital transformation will provide better value for money. We're prioritising those which handle over 100,000 transactions per year and those which support the projects within our Transforming Justice programme.

These include transactions for fine payment, claims lodgement and tracking offenders through the criminal justice system, where we are exploring the potential for digitisation.

We will also be tackling many services where the volumes are lower, but better value for money could be realised. And we will explore opportunities where changing an existing process would make delivery of a new digital service possible.

We will publish our priorities by March 2013, once we have further assessed the potential for digital transformation.

###Service Managers
Service Managers (known as Product Managers in the private sector) will be accountable for the quality and usage of the digital services.

They will:


- champion the needs of users for the duration of each service
- join up policy, operational and digital delivery teams
- combine a deep understanding of the business with knowledge of digital

By March 2013 we will have recruited five Service Managers with proven experience of delivering effective digital services. We will also try to identify Associate Digital Service Managers within the business and train them with the necessary skills.

###Information provision
We will converge the Ministry of Justice's corporate content to [Inside Government](https://www.gov.uk/government) by April 2013, and agency and specialist content to the site by April 2014.

We rewrote all of our Directgov and Business Link content to meet the mainstream user needs of citizens and businesses for the launch of GOV.UK in October this year.

As with the mainstream content, we will not automatically move all specialist content on the justice.gov.uk website to GOV.UK. We will ensure that it is rewritten and repurposed to meet clearly identified user needs and presented in user-friendly formats.

###Continuously improving our services
Once we have transformed our services we need to ensure we continue to develop them based on user feedback. Currently there is little robust user information for our services, as they were not designed to capture performance data.

We will work with our department's Analytical Services team to develop and apply better management information and customer insight and make full use of feedback across our services. This data-driven approach will allow us to continuously improve our services and meet user needs more effectively.

This applies as much to information as to transactions. The right information is a vital part of the service to ensure that people access the justice system when they really need to, know what to expect and can navigate the system successfully.

{div .infobox}
Using digital to improve our working practices, creating a digital organisation through:

6. Bringing digital skills in-house to establish our Digital Services Division by April 2013 and making stronger links with talent outside government.
7. Extending digital leadership and capability at Director and Deputy Director levels and establishing a network of digital champions at Band A during 2013-14.
8. Making full use of digital technology to become more transparent, make data more accessible and improve performance, accountability and service.
9. Supporting flexible working through more effective use of digital technology.
10. Adopting agile development to design, deliver and continuously improve digital services at pace.
11. Enabling ICT, Information Assurance and Procurement to adopt a more flexible way of working to support digital transformation.


Relates to Government Digital Strategy actions [one](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/strategy/#action-01), [three](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/strategy/#action-03) and [four](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/strategy/#action-04).
{/div}

###Digital capability and leadership
The digital future requires radically different ways of working.

Until recently, investment in digital services at the Ministry of Justice has been inconsistent and unco-ordinated, leading to duplication and inefficiency.

There was a small centre of digital capability, but limited awareness of the digital by default agenda or understanding of digital opportunities across the department.

Organisations with a digital culture are open, innovative, flexible and encourage their people to experiment and use their initiative.

We have made good headway during 2012 in moving digital into the mainstream operation of the Ministry of Justice and putting digital leadership in place. We have:

- established the Director General, Transforming Justice as Digital Leader to champion digital by default at our Departmental Board
- created a new Digital Services Division with Senior Civil Service leadership as a centre of digital expertise to develop and lead the implementation of this strategy and build capability in the business
- brought senior decision-makers from across the department together through our Digital Transformation Board to oversee the Digital Transformation Portfolio, which will help deliver the programmes and projects in our roadmap

The Digital Services Division will:


- own and be accountable for the user experience across all of our digital services
- be a centre of digital expertise, providing strategic advice and specialist design and delivery skills
- act as a mandatory gateway for all of our digital projects

This will involve getting specialist talent in and giving them space to innovate. It's a very different approach to our current, largely outsourced, big supplier model.

The Digital Services Division model will be to:

- collaborate with and learn from the best digital talent outside government
- work with the Government Digital Service (GDS) to benefit from the strong links being developed with small and medium enterprises
- enable more effective partnerships within and outside the department to deliver the best digital solutions

We'll also develop capability within the department. We will ensure those developing proposals have the right capability in 'digital thinking' to know how user-centered digital design should influence policy and delivery, and who to consult to achieve this.

To build capability, we are:


- increasing digital understanding among our Directors and Deputy Directors through mandatory digital training during 2013
- developing internal training and setting up a network of digital 'champions' at Band A level
- using training programmes run by GDS and our own programmes

These steps will embed digital understanding across the department, so staff are better equipped to decide what services should be delivered digitally.

###Supporting flexible working
Digital by default is a core theme running through the [Civil Service Reform Plan](http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Civil-Service-Reform-Plan-acc-final.pdf), which states that “central government wherever possible must become a digital organisation”.

Achieving this presents us with a significant challenge.

The Ministry of Justice has a large workforce with a diverse range of skills – from administrators within courts that keep the justice system moving, to probation workers managing offenders in the community. Increasingly, our staff are not location-based.

We are already exploring better use of digital technologies including:


- replacing intranets and collaboration tools with a single workspace for staff 
- sharing data to allow more effective work with partners and suppliers
- using video to support flexible working

By exploiting the full potential of video technology we can radically improve the way we work and deliver services. For example, by removing the need to transport prisoners to court we can make best use of staff time and our estate.

###Using digital to be more transparent and accountable
Digital technology will make it easier for our department to be transparent, allowing us to be more open about our performance and allowing others to hold us to account more easily.

We have already made some good progress in this area, for example:


- publishing 'justice outcomes' on [police.uk](http://www.police.uk/)
- data visualisation of sentencing, reoffending and court statistics on [open.justice.gov.uk](http://open.justice.gov.uk/)

We could go further. In line with our [open data strategy](http://www.data.gov.uk/library/moj-open-data-strategy) we are working to understand demand for information about the justice system and will continue to make our data accessible and reusable.

###Adopting agile development
We are looking at how we manage digital projects themselves. Adopting an 'agile' approach will help us to develop services more effectively and at pace.

This is challenging for government, which in the past has been criticised for a lack of rigour in the management of projects and has since invested in traditional project and programme management skills. These now need to be further developed to enable us to fully benefit from the flexibility that agile brings.

{div .infobox}
<span>Agile</span> is an approach where projects and products progress and develop in incremental iterations. The product works from a very early stage, so improvement can be made based on real user feedback and testing.
{/div}

These principles are unfamiliar to all but a few in government, and to adopt an agile approach we will need to educate and equip our staff. We will start by establishing agile delivery through the Digital Services Division and in the design and development of our exemplar services.

###Realising new ways of working
To support an agile way of working we will need to change our existing approaches to scoping ICT solutions, managing risk and procuring new suppliers.

We will seek to develop more effective partnerships, both internally and externally.

The Digital Services Division will provide strategic advice to existing processes in each of these areas to help break barriers to digital transformation.

Increasing the pace and ease of digitisation, through:

12. Accessing a wider range of suppliers, with an emphasis on small and medium enterprises, and running leaner, faster tendering processes.
13. Prioritising use of open source technologies.
14. Taking steps to measure performance and deliver real-time management information.
15. Identifying and removing legislative barriers to digitising services.
16. Identifying, developing and using common components and services.


Relates to Government Digital Strategy actions [ten](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/strategy/#action-10), [eleven](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/strategy/#action-11), [twelve](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/strategy/#action-12) and [thirteen](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/strategy/#action-13).

{/div}
The justice system has evolved over a long time, and many of its processes can no longer cope effectively with demand.

As with many government systems, there are problems with:

- outdated technology
- complex and lengthy procedures
- general resistance to change
- objections due to perceived issues of security, cost, reliability and take-up

To achieve digital by default we'll need to remove the barriers throughout the system.

###Using a wider range of suppliers
We have to recognise that we're not always best placed to build solutions in-house and need to use a wider range of partner organisations.

As a first step, we'll need to have access to a wider range of smaller suppliers rather than automatically relying on a small number of big IT suppliers. We will work with those who have the most relevant skills and are faster and more flexible, with an emphasis on using small and medium enterprises (SMEs).

Our delivery model will be mixed: some services will be developed in-house by the Digital Services Division, others by SMEs working alongside our staff (which has the added benefit of transferring knowledge) and still others delivered by GDS or outsourced entirely.

###Using open source solutions
We will favour the use of open source solutions wherever possible.

{div .infobox}
<span>Open source</span> solutions are freely available for all to use, and developed by the community that use them. An example of open source software is [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/), the blogging platform.
{/div}
The main benefit will be in working with the wider development community, who are continually improving these shared solutions. In turn, our contribution to developing these solutions will benefit SMEs and support economic growth.

###Effective management information systems
A further barrier to successful digitisation is the lack of an effective management information system.

Many of our services were not designed to capture the data we need about our users and performance.

We will work with our business to understand how we can develop better real time management information. As we begin to redesign our services we will take a modular approach, building automated data collection into each one.

###Overcoming legislative obstacles
Across many services, legislation passed before the growth of digital constrains the development of simple end-to-end digital services.

The Ministry of Justice will commit to identifying and removing legislative obstacles. In practice this could mean reviewing current restrictive interpretations of laws or amending legislation that prevent us from developing straightforward, convenient digital services. An immediate example is the need for a wet signature that prohibits full digitisation across many of our services.

As legislation can take time to change, in the interim we will get on with delivering partial digital solutions, but always with a view to realising the full potential for digitisation later.

###Using common technology platforms
The Cabinet Office will be delivering a new suite of common technology platforms to underpin the new generation of services that are digital by default. GOV.UK is the first and platforms for identity assurance, performance metrics, and others will follow.

These platforms will be used as core components in the development of all of our digital services.

In the interim, Digital Services Division will ensure that any services are built in a modular fashion, in order to take full advantage of these platforms as they emerge while maintaining momentum.

We will build with the maxim of 'loosely coupled but tightly integrated' modules as far as possible. This means that a service may temporarily use one solution for identity assurance or payments, but when a cross-government platform to answer this need is completed, the modules could be exchanged.

As well as identity assurance and metrics, common elements in our services include payments, booking appointments and case management. Many interactions with the justice system start in a similar way, for example submitting an application or lodging an appeal, and we will develop common solutions wherever possible.

{div .infobox}
Improving collaboration and helping people use our services, through:

17. Connecting staff, users and partners with each other and the information and tools they need to deliver digital solutions.
18. Opening-up policy making and engagement by increasing access to and effective use of social media.
19. Driving awareness and encouraging channel shift through more consistent and sustained communication, and collaborating with partners and stakeholders.
20. Providing other ways for people to access digital services if they are not able to do so independently.


Relates to Government Digital Strategy actions [eight](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/strategy/#action-08), [nine](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/strategy/#action-09) and [fourteen](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/strategy/#action-14).
{/div}

###Connecting staff, users and partners
Future policy and services must owe far more to collaboration within the department, across government, with front-line staff and public users.

This means finding ways to connect us all to work together in partnership.

We won't always need to build digital solutions, and can reuse tools that already exist in the marketplace.

Digital technology will allow us to collaborate more with our users and partners to improve our services together. Defaulting to open standards and making greater use of APIs in the development of our services will support this.

{div .infobox}

An <span>API</span> (or Application Programming Interface) is a way of making information available to other developers to use in tools and services. APIs allow developers to use information quickly and easily, and help to ensure that they can access data in the most efficient way available.

{/div}

Increasing collaboration will allow others outside of government to use our data to innovate and develop their own useful tools. Events such as 'hack days', where developers collaborate intensively on software projects, will help us explore these possibilities more fully.

###Opening up policy making
Digital tools will make it easier than ever before to engage the public and specialists in the policy-making process.

The [Civil Service Reform Plan](http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Civil-Service-Reform-Plan-acc-final.pdf) puts a great emphasis on this, calling on civil servants to use “web-based tools, platforms and new media to widen access to policy debates to individuals and organisations not normally involved.”

From 2013, we will respond to this commitment by working with policy teams to formalise a new model for open policy-making.

The emphasis will be on engaging and consulting more openly and informally throughout the policy cycle in the spaces where people are already having conversations. This includes online spaces such as blogs, chat rooms, Facebook, and Twitter.

We will support this with access to the right tools and understanding of how to use them effectively, including trialling open access to social media for staff early in 2013.

###Promoting 'channel shift' and digital services
As well as enabling our staff, we need to ensure the public are aware of our digital services and the shift away from other channels. The government ambition is for digital services to be so easy to access and use that all who can use them, choose to do so.

{div .infobox}
<span>Channel shift</span> refers to the move away from expensive channels like phone and post to less expensive digital solutions, like online self-service.

{/div}

This is a particular challenge for our department, as many members of the public and even some of our staff don't fully understand the justice system. Most don't understand when and how to interact with us, what to expect when they do or how justice decisions are made.

We will therefore design digital services to help people find, understand and use the justice system successfully.

We have no budget for paid-for communication channels and already work with staff, partners and stakeholders to provide information and promote services. In this context digital channels play an essential role in supporting communication.

In May 2012, [social media guidelines](http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/news/lets-get-social/how-to-use-social-media) were issued to civil servants based on six principles that encourage use of social media for consultation, engagement, transparency, accountability and 'to be part of the conversation with all the benefits that brings'.

Social media will allow us to communicate more effectively with all of our audiences, especially as most people use these channels routinely in their everyday lives. It will allow us to reach a wider audience faster at much lower cost, and communicate with people in the places where they already are. For example, [50% of the UK population now uses Facebook](http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/news/lets-get-social/how-to-use-social-media). To make the most of this we will need to be aware of the risks involved, but less risk averse.

We will work with our behavioural insight team to work out how to encourage 'channel shift' (the move to digital channels) so all those who are online benefit from our improved digital services. We know that channel shift takes time, so we'll carry out communications planning to ensure people are ready for the change.

###'Assisted digital': providing other ways to access digital services
In moving to digital services, we need to ensure that no-one gets left behind.

{div .infobox}
<span>Assisted digital</span> is the way the government is helping users who are not online to access services they're entitled to.
{/div}

The digital by default commitment means that digital becomes the default option for people who can use it. It also means reducing the number of non-digital channels and providing alternative ways to enable as many people as possible to access digital services as the default method. [Research](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/research/#fig-1) shows that 18% of adults have rarely or never been online.

Given the breadth of our user base, not everyone who uses our services will currently be able to access them digitally, and we are committed to ensuring that our digital services are accessible to all.

As we introduce new digital services we will consider where more effective methods can be used as a 'way in' to access these. What we provide for people will depend on the service and the needs of the user, but we will look to work with a range of external partners to ensure that the right level of support is provided, focusing on those who need the most help.

In developing assisted digital, the Digital Services Division will work closely with the dedicated assisted digital team in the GDS. We will operate within the standards being established by the GDS and will look to procure collaboratively to ensure an efficient and consistent approach.

In 2013, we will develop assisted digital support for applicants for a Lasting Power of Attorney.

By April 2015, we will look to provide more assistance for offline users when we deliver our four 'exemplar' services.

While we are committed to delivering digital by default services, this is about making government digital, not the country as a whole. However, we will consider opportunities where we can support development of digital capability and inclusion among our users.
