##03 Vision
Our vision for the Ministry of Justice is to put the user first in designing services that are digital by default.
We will achieve this by:

- Establishing a digital by default approach to all services by 2013.
- Delivering four exemplar digital services by March 2015.
- Making the Ministry of Justice a digitally capable organisation by 2015.
- Digitally redesigning all current services by 2018.
- Digitising every aspect of the justice system possible by 2020.
