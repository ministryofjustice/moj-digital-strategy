##04 Scope
The Ministry of Justice is working to reform the justice system through our [Transforming Justice programme](http://www.justice.gov.uk/about/justice/transforming-justice) which focuses on:

- delivering better rehabilitation of offenders to prevent reoffending
- a smarter system of detaining and educating teenage offenders
- a cheaper and more effective prison system
- a legal aid system that commands public confidence
- a criminal justice and court system that works effectively and puts victims first

Digital transformation will support these priorities by:


- delivering better information to allow users to make more informed decisions about when and how to interact with us
- delivering better, less costly services to make it easier, faster and cheaper for people to use the system
- transforming the operational, structural or cultural processes and practices which support our information and service provision

Our strategy focuses on how we will start to move towards a digital future, but does not provide a detailed review of every information asset, transaction, service, channel or process. We will develop detailed implementation plans to support priority projects in the coming months, and focus on digital transformation of those services where it provides better value for money.

The Ministry of Justice provides some services online, but often only part of the process is digitised. Most of these could be extensively if not fully digitised. This would be better value and provide a much better user experience.

Some of our services are not online at all and still rely on paperwork or call centres, and these could be digitised.

In many cases we would like to see less demand on our services through reduced reoffending or fewer civil and family cases, where disputes could be resolved outside court. In some cases, successful services may well be those which are used less.

And many of our users have a choice about whether they formally engage in the justice system. This makes the interaction between our online information and services of particular importance, to ensure that only those people who need to use the justice system do so.

Redesigning services to respond to user needs is highlighted as the most important part of the Government Digital Strategy, and will be a significant change in approach within our department.

The potential for all of this to improve public confidence in the justice system should not be underestimated.

If we don't focus on the user outcome we're trying to achieve when we design policy, information, services and processes, how can we know that the solutions we're putting in place will meet user needs and deliver our business objectives?

Digital transformation is essentially about our department developing better business strategy, informed by user understanding.
