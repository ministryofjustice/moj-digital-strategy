##02 Executive summary
The [Civil Service Reform Plan](http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/reform), [Government Digital Strategy](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/strategy/) and [Digital Efficiency Report](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/efficiency/) have already made the case for digital by default, estimating savings of £1.8 billion per year and setting out [14 actions](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/strategy/#principles-and-actions) to realise, notably:

- more efficient and convenient services for users
- decreased demand for higher cost channels

Our strategy sets out how the Ministry of Justice will become digital by default.

<div class="infobox">
By digital by default, we mean digital services that are so straightforward and convenient that all those who can use them will choose to do so, while those who can't are not excluded.

By digital we mean internet-enabled: such as desktop, laptop, tablet, mobile or digital devices not yet invented. We also include video and non-networked digital devices such as kiosks.
</div>'

This means wherever possible our services, including information and transactions, will be delivered through digital channels, rather than face-to-face, phone or post.

It will involve changing the way we work, and transforming our processes and practices.

Most importantly, digital services will be designed around the needs of our users, whether public, practitioners, staff, partner organisations or stakeholders.

Those who may struggle to access or use these services by themselves will be given support so they're not excluded by these changes.

Digital transformation will help us design and deliver services that are more effective, less costly and more responsive for our users.

It will also contribute to more consistent and co-ordinated services across government.



We will take 20 actions, grouped under four overarching themes:

####Transforming our services
Delivering services that meet user needs, through:

1. Delivering four exemplar digital services by March 2015: prisoner visits booking; civil claims (money and possession claims); fee payment (starting with employment tribunal fees); and digital transformation of the [Office of the Public Guardian](http://www.justice.gov.uk/about/opg) (starting with applications for Lasting Power of Attorney).
2. Digitally redesigning all other services, prioritising those handling over 100,000 transactions per year, to meet the new [digital by default service standard](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/strategy/#initial-outline-of-proposed-digital-by-default-transactional-service-standard).
3. Establishing service managers to oversee the design, delivery and ongoing management of each service.
4. Completing the transition to [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/) for all our services.
5. Applying user insight and responding swiftly to continuously improve our services.

####Transforming the way we work
Using digital to improve our working practices, creating a digital organisation through:

6. Bringing digital skills in-house to establish our Digital Services Division by April 2013 and making stronger links with specialists outside government.
7. Extending digital leadership and capability at Director and Deputy Director levels and establishing a network of digital champions at Band A during 2013.
8. Making full use of digital to become more transparent, make data more accessible and improve performance, accountability and services.
9. Supporting flexible working through more effective use of digital technology.
10. Adopting agile development to design, deliver and continuously improve digital services at pace.
11. Enabling ICT, Information Assurance and Procurement to adopt a more flexible way of working that supports digital transformation.

####Breaking barriers to digital transformation
Increasing the pace and ease of digitisation, through:

12. Accessing a wider range of suppliers, with an emphasis on small and medium enterprises, and running leaner, faster tendering processes.
13. Prioritising use of open source technologies.
14. Taking steps to measure performance and deliver real-time management information.
15. Identifying and removing legislative barriers to digitising services.
16. Identifying, developing and using common components and services.

####Transforming how we engage
Improving collaboration and helping people use our services, through:

17. Connecting staff, users and partner organisations with each other and the information and tools they need to deliver digital solutions. 
18. Opening up policy-making and engagement by increasing access to and effective use of social media.
19. Driving awareness and encouraging channel shift through more consistent and sustained communication, and collaborating with partners and stakeholders.
20. Providing other ways for people to access digital services if they are not able to do so independently.

This strategy supports the five priorities within our [Transforming Justice programme](http://www.justice.gov.uk/about/justice/transforming-justice) and provides a framework for service transformation during the remainder of this spending review and the lifetime of the next review.

It will be updated annually alongside our business plan and the digital roadmap developed with our business – including executive agencies, major public bodies and the judiciary – to assess current and planned digital services across the justice system.

To lead the implementation of the strategy and champion digital transformation we have appointed a Digital Leader to our Departmental Board and created a new Digital Services Division as a centre of expertise.

However, everyone across our organisation – not just digital specialists – will have to be involved and committed to these actions to make the strategy a reality and make the Ministry of Justice a digitally capable organisation for the future.
