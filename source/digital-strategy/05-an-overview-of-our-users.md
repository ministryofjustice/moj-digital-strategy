##05 An overview of our users
Users are at the centre of delivering digital by default.

A wide range of people among the general public use our services, in addition to the staff, partner organisations, practitioners, businesses and stakeholders who help provide these services and use the processes that support them.

It is not possible to reflect all these user groups in detail within this strategy, what is important is to understand the breadth of user types, and identify common insights into what they are seeking from the justice system which better digital services can support.

Individuals engage with the Ministry of Justice in a number of ways, for example:

- *criminal justice system:* offenders, victims and witnesses, jurors
- *civil and family systems:* those seeking to make claims, settle disputes and resolve family breakdown
- *administrative justice system:* those seeking redress for grievances, for example against the state

Anyone could come into contact with the justice system at some point in their lives, but some demand comes from groups who are more frequent users of government services.

They may have a number of concerns such as mental health problems, disability, lack of education, drug or alcohol addiction, being on benefits or in debt.

Demand also comes from bulkÂ’ users of our services, for example:

- *criminal justice system:* barristers and solicitors working on criminal cases and involved in criminal legal aid schemes
- *civil, family and administrative systems:* local authorities and businesses filing claims, and barristers and solicitors supporting these cases and involved in civil legal aid schemes
- *administrative justice system:* organisations seeking redress for grievances

Nearly all of our users find themselves in a complicated, pressured or stressful situation, want simple, relevant information and swift, easy access to services that deliver the desired result. Digital by default will help achieve this.

We will be gathering more data on specific user needs to inform the digital redesign of each of our services and help us meet those needs more effectively.
